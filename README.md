## 6502 CPU Emulator

### How to build 
This project uses CMAKE build tool. Follow the steps below to build:
Create a build directory with ``` mkdir build ```

1. ``` cd build ```
2. ``` cmake .. ``` - to generate necessary build files
3. ``` make ``` - use the build tool generated by CMAKE to compile the project 
4. ``` ./main ``` - to run the app generated by make

### Checking Endianness
If on Linux OS, open terminal and run:  
```lscpu | grep "Byte Order"```

### Debugging

You have to build the executable to include ``` -g ``` compile flag to enable debugging with GDB. Use this sequence of
 commands:

``` cd build ```
``` cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug .. ```
``` make ```

To debug with GDB:
``` gdb main```  
```(gdb) b 43``` - look at the source code and set a breakpoint at line 43
``` (gdb) run ``` - to run the debugger
``` (gdb) step ``` - to step through the program
